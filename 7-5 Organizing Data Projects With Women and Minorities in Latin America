ラテンアメリカの女性やマイノリティとのデータプロジェクトの組織化
Written by Eliana A. Vaca Muñoz
概要

この章では、ラテンアメリカの女性やマイノリティとデータプロジェクトを組織することについて論じる。

キーワード：アナログ・データビズ、マイノリティ、女性、ラテンアメリカ、データジャーナリズム教育、データビジュアライゼーション
チカス・ポデロサス（パワフルな女たち）はジャーナリスト、デザイナー、開発者による国境を越えたネットワークで、ラテンアメリカ中の女性や社会から疎外されたコミュニティによるデジタルメディアプロジェクトの開発に取り組んでいます。
私はチカス・ポデロサスのデザイナーとして、文化的遺産、アイデンティティ、社会権力の独占、女性と脆弱な人々の認識を探求するための学際的かつ参加型の研究を含め、文化と多様性のエージェントとしてデザインが果たすことができる役割を探求しています。
この章では、コロンビアと中米にあるいくつかのチカス・ポデロサスのイニシアチブ組織について検討する。
コロンビアにおける社会的・文化的不平等が拡大 するなか、少数派の声に耳を傾け、知識を共有し、対等に扱われることが重要である。
私たちのチームは、データジャーナリズムと関連するデジタルメディアの実践に焦点を当てた、一連の共同ワークショップを実施しました。
以下のセクションでは、これらのワークショップへの参加を促進するために用いた2つの方法、すなわちアナログ・データ収集とアナログ・データの視覚化について考察します。
これらのアプローチは、接続性、デバイス、技術的リテラシーを当然と考えることができないコミュニティや地域におけるデータ・ジャーナリズムの実践と文化に関連すると考えられます。



Analogue Data Collection
In May 2016, Chicas Colombia went to Villa España in Quibdó, Chocó, to work with women and teenagers belonging to the AJODENIU (Association of Displaced Youth) collective. Since 2002 this group has worked to defend the interests and rights of children displaced from Chocó, Río Sucio, Bojayá and Urabá. These regions are all difficult to access, with no Internet and few support services available. Therefore, the workshops began with analogue techniques to collect qualitative data. With this data, we worked to construct stories on issues such as forced displacement and teenage pregnancy, by recording spoken and written narratives.1

Building on these approaches, we worked with the United Nations Development Programme in Honduras in September 2018 to create a work- shop with the Observatorios de Municipales de Convivencia y Seguridad Ciudadana (Municipal Observatories for Coexistence and Citizen Security). They worked with data on violent deaths of men and women and were interested in presenting data disaggregated by gender. Two of the goals were to create emotional pathways to initiate conversations with the community around these difficult topics through participatory activities, and to use limited resources to share sensitive and important data.

At these workshops the initial steps are ice-breaking activities with simple and funny questions (Figure 47.1). At the Honduras workshop there were difficulties in discussing violence with participants due to different societal norms as well as language barriers. Thus, we focused the workshop on different exploratory data-gathering activities to surface different conceptions and experiences of violence. We used drawings, pictures and photographs to create posters together. Participants could add stickers to these as a way to gather data—including on the way they envisaged themselves, on their understanding of rights and on how they had experienced different kinds of domestic violence (e.g., physical, psychological, economic) in their own lives.



Analogue Data Visualisation
In an effort to better understand the issues plaguing Indigenous communities, in 2017 we planned interactive workshops with the Embera Tribe of the Vigía del Fuerte region. The workshops sought to provide a window into their lives in spite of language barriers. Historically, interactions between the tribe and outsiders have been largely male-dominated, so we prioritized accessing the female populations in order to gauge their levels of education and facilitate discussions regarding empowerment.

In the absence of modern technologies, we explored traditional expressions of culture as a means to more meaningfully access the lives of our participants. These expressions included traditional practices such as weaving, beading and craftwork (Figure 47.2).

In September 2018 in Honduras, we ran a workshop around the question of how to “humanize” data, conducting resiliency projects with victims and populations at risk. We designed low-cost analogue data visualization workshops with empathetic design techniques using scissors, papers, stickers, post-its and balloons. These served to facilitate the sharing of sensitive information with relevant organizations to better support these communities, as well as teaching different methods that vulnerable and low-literacy populations could use to share data about their lives, experiences and issues. For example, we worked with participants to create analogue visualizations about murders and femicides by region, type and age.

In another workshop in Belize we explored different collaborative approaches to visualizing data about crime and violence. We originally set out to see how data from the Belize Violence Observatory could be used to coordinate different kinds of collective responses. While participants had high levels of literacy, the technological resources and connectivity were much more precarious, making it difficult to use basic online visualization tools. This raised many questions and challenges about online data visualization practices, which are often taken for granted, but which would not work in the settings we were in—again suggesting the relevance of analogue approaches to data visualization using more readily available materials.
