数字を語り、価値観のトラブルに寄り添う
Written by: Helen Verran
2009 年に、（オーストラリア南東部のヴィクトリア）州が、コランガマイト自然資源管理区域の農村部の土地所有者による生態系の価値を高めるための環境介入を補助する取引がオーストラリア全体のGDPに貢献したのは、494万豪ドルと計算されています。
ここで紹介した数字は、同年、ヴィクトリア州政府が発表したプレスリリースからの引用です。オーストラリアには57の自然資源管理地域（Natural Resource Management Regions: NRMR）がありますが、これらの地域で州政府による環境保全への投資が成功したことを発表したのでした。
州南西部に東西に広がる玄武岩の草原からなる環境管理地域は、19世紀半ばにタスマニアからこの国に入植した初期のイギリス人牧畜民が付けた地名に代わり、アボリジニの言葉で「コランガマイト（Corangamite）」と名付けられた。
彼らはこの地域を「オーストラリア・フェリックス（Australia Felix）」と呼び、あらゆる木を伐採しました。後に地主となった不法占拠者たちは、1世紀も経たないうちに、ある種の植民地的な大地主となったのです。
2008 年、州政府は、コランガマイト国立森林管理局で（オークション型環境支払い政策の）エコテンダー・プログラムを実施し、不法占拠者の子孫から生態系サービスの価値を金額に換算して入札制オークションで購入しました。
これらの取引による2009年のオーストラリアのGDPへの寄与は、494万豪ドルと算出されました。私がこの価値を知ったのは、取引額を報じるメディアの発表がきっかけでした。
この報告書で公表されたニュースを、その価値を含めて取り上げたジャーナリストはいなかったのではないでしょうか。この数字は決してホットなニュースではありませんでした。
プレスリリースの文脈では、特定の数値に紐付けることは安心感を与えてくれます。GNPは重要かつ現実的なものであり、この州政府の介入が国民経済に貢献する特定の価値として特徴づけられるならば、政府の介入は明らかに良いことになります。
価値の特定は、政府の介入がもたらす改善の現実性を主張し、この政策が良い環境ガバナンスにつながることをほのめかします。
もちろん、数字(494万豪ドル)が指し示す実際の価値が暗黙のうちに何を指標化しているのかということに、関心を持つ人は多くありません。数字が、価値のある何かに対応しているように見えることは、（私たちを）十分安心させて（探求をやめさせるの）です。
この数字に関する私の物語は、その数字がどんな社会技術によって命を吹き込まれのかを、くどいくらいに詳細に説明しています。
この話は、無味乾燥なメディアリリースのありふれた数字が紙一重の隠蔽であることを明らかにします。深遠な問題が潜んでいるのです。
ありふれたことであっても、（安易に）評価を行うことに影を落とす深遠な問題について説明を始める前に、データ・ジャーナリズム・ハンドブックの読者のために、あらかじめ予想されるいくつかの質問に先に答えてみましょう。
第一に、ある数字がどのようにして命を吹き込まれたかを語るのではなく、その数字が特定の文脈で何を意味するのかを可視化する手段を見つけることは、現代のデータ・ジャーナリズムでは珍しいアプローチです。
データ・ジャーナリストがそのような話をしてもうまくいくのかと疑っているのは想像に難くありません。これに対する答えは、それがどちらか一方の選択ではなく、ストーリーを絡み合わせ、解読と解釈のリソースを可視化することが、アイデアを伝えるための効果的な方法であることを思い出させることです。
このような絡み合いを提示するにあたり、ジャーナリストは、ナラティブとビジュアルをミックスする場合は、二つの基本的な姿勢があることを常に覚えておく必要があります。
一つは、ビジュアルをナラティブに組み込んで話を進める場合です。話を進めるうえで、ナラティブの中で表現したり、説明したりしているように見えるビジュアルに言及することになるでしょう。
ナラティブがビジュアルの中に埋め込まれているように話を進めることもできます。その場合、あなたは図表の中で発言することになります。これはデータ・ジャーナリズムではあまり一般的ではありませんが、私がここで話すストーリーはこのような方法が使えるでしょう。
もちろん、一つの作品の中でこれらの話す位置を切り替えるのが最も効果的な戦略かもしれません。
第二に、意思決定や政策設計において明確な権限を持っているのはどこか、そしてデータ・ジャーナリストが興味を持っているのが、あれこれのアルゴリズムを利用してデータセットから何ができるかということなのに、特定の数字をあげつらうのはおかしいと思うかもしれません。
この心配に基づき、数字とデータセットの関係について尋ねることもあるでしょう。このような質問に対する答えは、かなり単純明快で、面白みには欠けます。
データセットの中にはたくさんの数値があります。数値は非常に精密な配列で組み立てられていますが，関係は一対多の関係です。
より興味深いのは、数とアルゴリズムの関係についての質問です。私の答えは、アルゴリズムがデータベースに埋め込まれた関係の処理を精巧に記述したプロトコルを一方で、数は集合的な存在の関係をどのように処理するかを規定したプロトコルを表しているということです。
ナンバリングはアルゴリズムの一形態であり、その逆もまた然りです。数字とアルゴリズムは、種子とそこから発芽する植物のように、比喩を用いれば鶏と卵のような関係にあります。
小学生に教えるような従来のアナログ的な手段（認知的、言語的、グラフィック的なリソースを混ぜ合わせたもの）によって列挙された値を生成することと、デジタル計算によって列挙された値を対比させることとは、興味深いほどに異なる社会技術的な特徴がありますが、ここで重要なのは同質性の方なのです。
494万豪ドル（という金額）はアルゴリズム的に生成され、特定のデータセットに埋め込まれた特定の関係のセットを表現していますが、（この段階では）まだ単なる数字です。
さて、ここで私のストーリーに移りましょう。ここでストーリーとして紹介する数字の生成をめぐる詳細な説明を読んだジャーナリストは、政府がメディアを通じてひそかに誘しようとする（一見）良いニュースが、一筋縄ではいかないことを認識することでしょう。
これは（むしろ）政治的な暴露記事というべきかもしれません。数字がどのように作られているかの詳細を見ると、この官民パートナーシップ環境介入プログラムが、国家が非常に裕福な地主の財産の価値を高めるためにお金を払っているものなのは明らかです。
私の記事は、ジャーナリストがどうやって、こうした数字を称賛するか（裏側を）暴露するかを見極められるのかといった疑問を呼ぶかもしれません。ストーリーの終わりには、それが的確な質問ではないとお分かりいただけるでしょう。

Narrating a Number

What is the series of socio-technical processes by which ecosystems services value come into existence in this PPP programme in order that this value might be traded between government as buyer and landowner as vendor? And exactly how does the economic value of the trade come to contribute to the total marginal gains achieved in the totality of Australian economic activity, Australia’s gross domestic product (GDP)? I attend to this double-barrelled question with a step by step laying out of what is required for a landholder to create a product – ‘ecosystems services value’ – that can compete in a government organised auction for a contract to supply the government with ‘ecosystem services value’. The messy work in which this product comes to life involves mucking around in the dirt, planting tree seedlings, fixing fences, and generally attempting to repair the damage done to the land perhaps by the landowner’s grandparents, who heedlessly and greedily denuded the country of trees and seeded it with water hungry plants, in hopes of more grain or more wool and family fortune. Ecosystems services value is generated by intervening in environmental processes.

The value which is the product to be traded, begins in the work of public servants employed by a Victorian State Government department (at that time Department of Sustainability and Environment, DSE). Collectively these officials decide the areas of the State within which the administration will ‘run’ tenders. In doing this, EnSym, an environmental systems modelling platform is a crucial tool.This computing capacity is a marvel, it knows ‘nature out there’ as no scientist has ever known nature. Precise and focussed representations can be produced—probably overnight.

‘This software has been developed by the ecoMarkets team and incorporates science, standards, metrics and information developed within DSE, as well as many leading international and national scientific models.

EnSym contains three main tools – the ‘Site Assessment Tool’ for field work, the ‘Landscape Preference Tool’ for asset prioritization and metric building, and ‘BioSim’ for catchment planning’.4

Prioritizing and mapping the areas of the State where auctions will be established, specifying and quantifying the environmental benefits, the ecological values, that might be enhanced through on-ground conservation and revegetation works, are recorded in numerical form. They represent ecosystem properties in the out-there land. And the computer program can do more than that, it can also produce a script for intervention by humans. Just as the script of a play calls for production, so too does this script. And, as that script comes to life, nature out-there seems to draw closer. It ceases to be an entirely removed ‘nature out there’ and becomes nature as an infrastructure of human lives, an infrastructure that we might poke around in so as to fix the ‘plumbing’.

When the script for a choreographed production of collective human effort is ready, in the next step the government calls for expressions of interest from landholders in the project area. In response to submitted expressions of interest, a government officer visits all properties. We can imagine this officer as taking the general script generated by EnSym along to an actual place at a given time. He or she has a formidable translation task ahead.

The field officer assesses possible sites for works that might become a stage for the production of the script. The aim is to enhance the generation of the specified ecosystems services, so the officer needs to assess the likelihood that specified actions in a particular place will produce an increase in services provision from the ecosystem, thus increasing the value of that particular ecosystems service generated by that property, and through adding together the many such increases generated in this intervention program, by the state as a whole. Together the landowner and the government officer hatch a plan. In ongoing negotiation, a formalized management plan for specified plots is devised. The field officer develops this plan in contractable terms. Landholders specify in detail the actual work they will do to action the plan. Thus, a product that takes the form of a particular ‘ecosystems services value’ is designed and specified as a series of specified tasks to be completed in a specified time period: so many seedlings of this set of species, planted in this array, in this particular corner of this particular paddock, and fenced off to effect a conservation plot of such and such dimensions, using these materials.

Landholders calculate the cost of the works specified by the state, no doubt including a generous labour payment. They come up with a price the government must pay if it is to buy this product, a particular ‘ecosystems services value’. Here they are specifying the amount of money they are willing accept to undertake the specified works and hence deliver the ecosystems services value by the specified date. They submit relevant documents to the government in a sealed envelope.

So how does the subsequent auction work? Here EnSym becomes significant again in assessing the bids. Not only a knower of nature out there, and a writer of scripts for intervention in that ‘out there’ imagined as infrastructure, EnSym is also a removed judging observer that can evaluate the bids that have been made to produce that script, much like a Warner Brothers might evaluate competing bids to produce a movie. Bids are ranked according to a calculated ‘environmental benefits index’ and the price proposed by the landowner. We must suppose that the government buys the product which offers the highest ‘environmental benefits index’ per unit cost.

‘Bid assessment. All bids are assessed objectively on the basis of

the estimated change in environmental outcomes
the value of the change in environmental outcomes
the value of the assets affected by these changes (significance)
dollar cost (price determined by the landholder)
Funds are then allocated on the basis of best value for money’

When the results of the auction are announced, selected bidders sign a final agreement based on the management plan and submitted schedule of works as defined spatial and temporal organization. When all documents are signed, reporting arrangements are implemented and payment can begin.

‘DSE forwards payment to signed-up landholders on receipt of an invoice. Payments occur subject to satisfactory progress against actions as specified in the Management Agreement’

This is a good thing, right?
What I have laid out is a precise description of how to buy and sell ecosystems services value. This takes me back to the press release. A quick reading of the media statement might leave a reader with the impression that AUD4.94 million is the value of the additional natural capital value that this government programme has generated. At first glance AUD4.94 million appears to be the marginal gain in Australia’s natural capital value that was achieved in the program. But that is a mistake. AUD4.94 million is not the name of a natural capital value. I explain what this number name references below. At this point I want to stay with the product that has been bought and sold in this auction. This product is the trouble I want to stay with.

I want to ask about the value of the increase in “ecosystems services value” that this elaborate and rather costly government program has achieved. A careful reading of the details of the work by which this increase in value comes into being, reveals that nowhere and at no time in the process has that value ever been named or specified. The product that is so rigorously bought and sold is an absence. And worse there is literally no way that it could ever be otherwise. The program is a very elaborate accounting exercise for a means of giving away money. When this becomes clear to an outsider, it also becomes obvious that this actuality of what the exercise is has never been hidden. When it comes down to it, this program is a legitimate means for shifting money from the state coffers into the hands of private landowners.

Recognizing that this is a program of environmental governance in a liberal parliamentary democracy in which the social technology of the political party is crucial, let me as your narrator temporarily put on a party-political hat. Corangamite is an electorate that has a history of swinging between choosing a member of the left of centre party (Labor Party) or a member of the right of centre party (Liberal Party) to represent the people of the area in the Victorian Parliament. It is clearly in the interests of any government—left-leaning or right-leaning to appeal to the voters of the electorate. And there is no better way to do that than by finding ways to legitimately transfer resources from the state to the bank accounts of constituents. That there is no possibility of putting a number on the value of the product the state buys and the landowners sell here, is on this reading, of no concern.

So, let me sum up. Economically this program is justified as generating environmental services value. Described in this way this is a good news story. Taxpayer money used well to improve the environment and get trees planted to ameliorate Victoria’s excessive carbon dioxide generation. Problematically the increase in the value of Victoria’s natural capital cannot be named, articulated as a number, despite it being a product that is bought and sold. It seems that while there are still technical hitches, clearly, this is a good thing.

But equally, using a different economics this program can just as legitimately be described as funding the labour of tree planting to enhance property values of private landowners. It is a means of intervening to put right damage caused by previous government programs subsidising the misallocated labour of land clearing that in all likelihood the landowners grandparents profited by, creating a benefit which the landowner continues to enjoy. On this reading the government policy effected in EcoTender is an expensive program to legitimately give away tax payer money. Clearly, this is a bad thing.

On not disrespecting numbers and algorithms: staying with the troubles of value
So, what is a journalist to do? Writing as a scholar and not as a journalist, I can respond to that obvious question only vaguely. In beginning I return to my claim that the number name used in the press release is a paper-thin cover-up to divert attention from lurking trouble. As I see it valuation always brings moral trouble that can never be contained for long. The right question to ask I think is, “How might a data journalist respond to that moral trouble?”

First, I clear up the matter of the AUD$4.94 million. What is this figure? Where does this neatly named monetary value come from? This is how it is described in an academic paper offering critical commentary on the EcoTender program

‘Under this market-based model economic value from ecosystems services is created when the per-unit costs of complying with the conservation contract are less than the per-unit price awarded to the successful participants in the auction. While [for these sellers] some economic value is lost through the possibility of foregone production of marketed commodities, the participation constraint of rational landowners ensures that there will be a net increase in [economic] value created in the conduct of the auction’. 5

Under the economic modelling of this policy, the assumption is that landowners will efficiently calculate the costs they will incur in producing the government’s script for intervening in nature as infrastructure—in generating a more efficient performance of the workings of natural infrastructure. Of course, everyone assumes that a profit will be made by the landowner, although of course, it is always possible that instead of a profit the landowner will have miscalculated and made a loss, but that is of no interest to the government as the buyer of the value generated by the landowners’ labour.

What is of interest to the government is the issue of how this economic transaction can be articulated in a seemly manner. Quite a problem when the product bought and sold has existence solely within the circuit of an auction. The solution to this problematic form of being of the product is the elaborate complex and complicated technology of the national accounts system. Establishing a market for ecosystems services value, the government wants to show itself as making a difference in nature. And the national accounts are the very convenient place where this can be shown in monetary terms. The ‘environmental benefits index’ the particular value on the basis of which the government has purchased a particular product—an environmental services value, is ephemeral. It exists solely as a flash, a moment in the auction.6 Despite this difficulty in the form of its existence, by ingenious contrivance, both the means of buying and selling something that has a single ephemeral moment of existence is achieved, and evidence of the specific instance of economic activity can be incorporated into the national accounts, albeit that some economists have serious reservations about accuracy.7

AUD 4.94 million is remote from the action of the EcoTender program and from the nature it is designed to improve. But clearly if the government makes a statement that its programs have successfully improved a degraded and damaged nature it is best to find a way to indicate the extent of that improvement. It seems any number is better than none in this situation. And certainly, this is a happy, positive number. An unhappy, negative number that no doubt is available to the government accountants—the value of the cost of running the government program, would never do here. Why go on about this oddly out of place number name? Surely this is going a bit far? What is the harm of a little sleight of hand that is relatively easily picked up? My worry here is that this is misuse of a number that seems to be deliberate. It fails to respect numbers, and refuses to acknowledge the trouble that numbering, or in this case algorithming, always precipitates. It trashes a protocol.

My narrating of a number I found on a visit to a government website, has unambiguously revealed a government program that generates social goods and bads simultaneously. The sleight of hand number naming (using the precise value AUD 4.94 million in the media release) that I also found in my narration, points off to the side, at something that is always threatening to overwhelm us: valuation as a site of moral tension and trouble.

Is the big claim here that value is moral trouble that can never be contained for long? Value theory is a vast topic that has ancient roots in all philosophical traditions, and this is a rabbit warren of vast proportions that I decline to enter. I merely note that claims, often heard over that past thirty years, that the invisible hand of the market tames the moral trouble that tracks with value, is a dangerous exaggeration. Markets might find ways to momentarily and ephemerally tame value—as my story reveals. But the trouble with value always returns. Attending to that is the calling of the data journalist.

Here are a few suggestions on how a data journalist might respect numbers and algorithms—as protocols. When you are faced with an untroubled surface, where no hint of moral tension is to be found, but still something lurks, then ‘prick up’ your ears and eyes. Attune yourself to numbers and algorithms in situ; work out how to think with a number that catches at you. Find ways to dilate the peep-holes that number names cover. Cultivate respectful forms of address for numbers and algorithms in practicing curiosity in disciplined ways. Recognise that numbers have pre-established natures and special abilities that emerge in encounter; that the actualities of series of practices by which they come to be, matter. Be sure that when you can do these well enough, surprises lie in store. Interesting things happen inside numbers as they come to be.
