インドの土地紛争を記録する

Written by: Kumar Sambhav Shrivastava Ankur Paliwal
インドの土地は希少資源です。インドは世界の土地面積の2.4％しか占めていませんが、世界の人口の17％以上を支えています。世界で最も急速に経済成長を遂げている国の一つであるため、産業とインフラの成長という野心的なアジェンダを後押しするためには、広大な土地が必要となります。
今後15年間の開発プロジェクトには、少なくとも1100万ヘクタールの土地が必要と見積もられています。しかし、インドの人口の多くは、疎外されたコミュニティであり、彼らの生活基盤と生活様式は土地に依存しています。（すなわち）2億人以上の人々が森林に依存し、1億1,890万人が農地に依存しています。
競合する要求は紛争をもたらします。多くの場合、土地は国や企業によって強奪されたり、不正に手に入れられたりし、反対する者は虚偽の告発を受けて国の機関に逮捕され、わずかな補償金でコミュニティは立ち退きを強いられ、家は放火され、人々は殺されることになります。
カースト、階級、性別などの社会的格差もまた、土地闘争を煽っています。気候変動が引き起こす災害は、土地に依存しているコミュニティをさらに追い詰めています。インド全土で土地をめぐる多くの戦いが行われているのには、こうした背景があるのです。
インドの開発問題について書き始めたとき、私たちはそのような紛争にたくさん遭遇しました。しかし、辺境のストーリーをニューデリーの編集者に売り込むのは容易ではないことに気がついたのです。
主流メディアは、致命的な暴力に発展したものや訴訟になったものを除いて、土地の紛争を報道しませんでした。
少数のジャーナリストによる散発的な報道は、ほとんど影響を与えず、紛争の影響を受けた人々の声は聞こえないままでした。彼らの不安は放置されていたのです。
（私たちは）その理由について、記者と編集者が（土地を巡る）対立を（それぞれ）孤立した事件として見ていたからではないかと気付きました。






 We knew land conflicts were one of the most important stories about India’s political economy. But the question was how to sell it to editors and readers. We thought that if journalists could scale up their reporting on individual cases of conflicts to examine broader trends, their stories could not only have wider reach but might also show the intensity of various kind of conflicts and their impact on people, economy and the environment. The biggest challenge to achieving this was lack of a database which journalists could explore to see what trends are emerging around specific kind of conflicts such as conflicts about roads, townships, mining or the wildlife-protected areas. There was no such database of ongoing land conflicts in India. So we decided to build one.

In November, 2016, we started Land Conflict Watch, a research-based data journalism project, which aims to map and document all ongoing land conflicts in India. We developed a documentation methodology in consultation with academics working on land governance. We put together a network of researchers and journalists, who live across the country, to document the conflicts in their regions following this methodology.

For the purpose of this project, we defined land conflict as any situation that has conflicting demands or claims over the use or ownership of land, and where communities are one of the contesting parties. Ongoing conflicts where such demands or claims have already been recorded in a written or audio-visual format at any place, from the village level to the national level, are included. These records could be news reports, village assembly resolutions, records of public consultation for development projects, complaints submitted by people to government authorities, police records or court documents. Conflicts such as the property disputes between two private parties or between a private party and the government are excluded unless they directly affect broader publics.

The researchers and journalists track national and local media coverage about their regions and interact with local activists, community organisations and lawyers to find cases of conflicts. They then collect and verify information from publicly-available government documents, independent studies, and by talking to affected parties. Data such as location of conflict, reasons behind the conflicts, number of affected people, affected area, land type – whether private, common or forest –names of the government and corporate agencies involved and a narrative summary of the conflict are documented.

Researchers file all the data into reporting-and-review software built into the Land Conflict Watch website. Data is examined and verified by dedicated reviewers. The software allows to-and-fro work flow between the researchers and the reviewers before the data is published. The dashboard, on the portal, not only presents the macro picture of the ongoing conflicts at national level but zooms in to give details of each conflicts, along with the supporting documents to back data, at the micro level. It also provides the approximate location of the conflict on the interactive map.

About 35 journalists and researchers are currently contributing. As of September 2018, the project had documented over 640 cases. These conflicts affect close to 7.3 million people and span over 2.4 million hectares of land. Investments worth $186 billion USD are attached to projects and schemes affected by these conflicts.

As a conflict is documented, it is profiled on the portal as well as on social media to give heads-up to national journalists and researchers. The project team then collaborates with journalists to create in-depth, investigative stories at the intersection of land rights, land conflicts, politics, economy, class, gender and the environment using this data. We also collaborate with national and international media to get these stories published. Many of these stories have been republished by other mainstream media outlets. We have also conducted trainings of journalists on the use of the database in finding and scaling up stories around land governance.

Land Conflict Watch is an ongoing project. Apart from designing stories, we also work with academics, researchers and students to initiate public debates. Land Conflict Watch’s data has been cited by policy think-tanks in their reports. Land-governance experts have written op-eds in national newspapers using the data. We regularly get requests from research students at the Indian and foreign universities to use our data in their research. Non-profit organisations use land conflict data, documents and cases to strengthen their campaign to fight for the land rights of conflict affected communities. The stories inform people and help shape discourse around land rights and governance related issues in India.
